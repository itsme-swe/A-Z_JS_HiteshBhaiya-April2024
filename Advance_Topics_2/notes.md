# Promises
A **Promise** is like a guarantee that something will happen in the future, and when it's done, you'll get the result you were expecting, whether it's success or failure. It helps handle asynchronous tasks, like fetching data from the internet or waiting for user input, in a structured and manageable way.

    Promise is having 3 states:

    ğŸ”¸pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.

    ğŸ”¸fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
    
    ğŸ”¸rejected: meaning that the operation failed
