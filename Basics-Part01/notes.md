# Keywords used to define variables in JS
**1. const -** const is also introduced in ES6 and is used to declare constants, whose values cannot be re-assigned and variables declared with const are block-scoped like let.

    const accountId = 21345

**2. let -** Variables declared with let are block-scoped, which means they are only accessible within the block they are declared in (e.g., within { } ). **let** variables can be reassigned but not re-declared within the same scope and **let** variables are not accessible before they are declared (this is known as the "temporal dead zone").

    let accountName = "Harsh Mehra"
